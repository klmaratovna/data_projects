| [Real Estate](https://github.com/maratovvna/data_projects/tree/main/Real%20Estate)      | Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale: entered by the user, automatical  cartographic data. | Given the data of the Realty service - an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. We need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate and set the parameters. | Data preparation |
| [Video Games](https://github.com/maratovvna/data_projects/tree/main/Video%20Games)      | Identification of the impact of video game characteristics on sales.     |   Conduct data analysis on the dependence of global sales on parameters such as release year, genre, release platform, reviews. Calculate the correlation between reviews and video game sales.| A/B Testing |
| [Tariffs](https://github.com/maratovvna/data_projects/tree/main/Tariffs) | Forecasting the most suitable Megaline tariff.      |    Given data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to the tariffs. We need to build a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate option. | Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression | 
| [Bank Clients](https://github.com/maratovvna/data_projects/tree/main/Banking) | Identify the model that most accurately predicts customer abandonment.      |    Build machine learning models, validate the parameters, test the prediction with the f1 metric and find the best option, improve the result by balancing the initial data. | Decsion Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, One-Hot Encoding, Grid Search |
| [Oil reserves](https://github.com/klmaratovna/data_projects/tree/main/Oil%20Reserves)      | Given the data of 3 regions, it is necessary to highlight the most promising region with the lowest risk of loss. | Building ML models for 3 regions, check forecasting with RMSE metric and find the best option, profit and risk. Apply bootstrap technique for normal distribution. | Linear Regression |
