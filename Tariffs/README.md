# Tariff recommendation.

Given data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to the tariffs. We need to build a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate option.

Building the model with the largest possible accuracy value. The accuracy level has to be at least 0.75.

## Project Description
Forecasting the most suitable Megaline tariff.

## Study description: 
To identify the model that most accurately predicts tariffs for customers, among the tariffs "Ultra", "Smart".

## Research purpose:
Build machine learning models, validate the parameters, check the accuracy of the forecast and find the best option.

## Research objectives:

- Examine input data,
- Split data into training, validation and test sets,
- Explore the decision tree model - Decision Tree Classifier , select the parameters and calculate the accuracy of this model,
- Explore Random Forest Model - Random Forest Classifier ,
- Explore the Logistic Regression model - Logistic Regression ,
- Test data against test set.
## Initial data:

- calls — number of calls,
- minutes — total duration of calls in minutes,
- messages — number of sms messages,
- mb_used - used Internet traffic in Mb,
- is_ultra - what tariff did you use during the month ("Ultra" - 1, "Smart" - 0).
